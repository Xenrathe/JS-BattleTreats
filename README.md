The BattleTreats app is a single-player game, in which players are tasked with feeding treats to their neighbor's dog before their neighbor (played by the computer) feeds all of their dogs! Whoever feeds their neighbor's dogs first makes all the dogs happy and therefore wins the game!

BattleTreats is active on GitHub pages: (https://xenrathe.github.io/JS-BattleTreats/)

### Features:

- Initial design followed TDD: Red -> Green -> Refactor (note: tests not currently updated)
- Fully responsive layout, including custom functions for touch-screen dragging/dropping of dog placement
- Super cool retro dot-matrix LED
- Intelligent AI makes smart plays and provides actual challenge

### Tech Stack:

- CSS: Vanilla
- JS: Bundled via Webpack, including various plugins
- Backend: N/A - no backend
- Other: testing done via Jest

### Future to-do list

- Add highlighting of cells when dragging or clicking dogs during placement
- Adjust touch-tap detection to be time-based rather than movement-based
- Update initial tests so they still pass
- Add functionality for 2 human player mode via "device/screen passing"

### Design Brief

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum, expanding on the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-battleship">Battleship</a> project.
