## To-do List:

- coords aren't being reset on the actual gameboard from dog rotation
- Dog dragging: When dragging vertical dog, it's all squished?
- Dog placement: More precise dragging / dropping
- AI bug w/ dog placement, not putting at 0 or 9 coords (rounding issue)
- Kennel button for random placement
- improve the dotmatrix some
- allow cancelling of new game
- instructions for placing dogs - overlap neighbor's yard?
- better new game button, better banner / logo
- responsive / mobile design
